                <h4><em>The Vanishing Half</em> - Brit Bennett</h4>
                <p><em>The Vanishing Half </em> follows the story of two Black twins with skin so fair, that they are able to pass as white. The sisters, Stella and Desiree, choose different paths - one passing for white and the other chooses to be Black. This is a profound story that covers racism, colorism and white privilege in America. The novel spans multiple decades telling the story of the family over three generations. As a reader, I really enjoyed that the novel switched viewpoints because it helped understand each character’s identity and how it could change over time.
                    <br> <br> 
                    The story had me hooked from the beginning. I finished reading it in only a few sittings. I constantly learned about family, race and privilege. I was most interested in Desiree’s daughter, Jude. Her story showed how identity and self-esteem are so interconnected. This is a beautiful and fascinating story. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it.

                <h4><em>This Close To Okay</em> - Leesa Cross-Smith</h4>
                <p>
                    Two people meet in strange circumstances on a bridge, where the man is ready to jump and the woman, a therapist, tries to prevent him. When he decides to get a cup of coffee with her, neither of them could anticipate what happens next. Over the course of a weekend, these two strangers divulge personal information while keeping important secrets. The tension is bound to break, and when it does, they find that the connection they built can help make the world seem okay.
                    <br><br>
                    I loved this story. While Tallie and Emmett are keeping secrets about their past, the information they share about themselves and their personalities is true. Tallie is extremely patient and open-minded. She continuously says that bringing a stranger home like this is so unlike her, but to me, it showed how deeply caring she is. Her intentions never seemed malicious. Emmett is a lost soul searching for a sign, meaning to go on living. The story is romantic, but not in a traditional way. I could not put this book down, and switching narration made it even more difficult. The content may be a bit unrealistic, as in a therapist could probably lose her job for this, it is a deeply moving story about the power of kindness and friendship.

                <h4><em>The Guest List</em> - Lucy Foley</h4>
                <p>
                    A list “you’d kill to be on” is the perfect hint for this book. Jules and Will are about to get married on a remote island. The story development progresses by focusing on the perspective of Jules the bride, Aofie the wedding planner, Hannah the plus one, Johnno the best man and Olivia the bridesmaid. The harsh environment brings secrets their friends have been keeping about themselves, Jules and Will to the surface. Someone is not leaving the wedding. 
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoyed reading this book. The way it switched viewpoints helped keep the story engaging as both moved it forward and provided multiple interpretations of single events. The environment elevated the thriller aspect of the book. While I was able to predict the ending, I would definitely recommend this story if you’re looking for a fun and spooky read.

                <h4><em>Such A Fun Age</em> - Kiley Reid</h4>
                <p>
                    Alix and Emira’s lives are connected in many ways but could not be more different. Alix is a wealthy, white mother of two, while Emira is in her 20s, Black and still figuring things out. Emira babysits Alix’s 2 year old daughter, Briar. One night, Alix asks Emira to watch Briar, way after Emira’s working hours. When Emira accepts, she has no idea that this night will change her life. Emira and Briar are walking around a grocery store, when a woman falsely accuses Emira of kidnapping the child. The racist interaction is recorded by another person in the store. Everything that happens next is a direct result of biases, racism and privilege. 
                        <br><br>
                    I could not put this book down. I learned so much about the cruel impact of microaggressions and unconscious or conscious biases. This book is a lesson about white privilege and the assumptions people make about those who are different than themselves. The scenes in the book are infuriating at times, and disappointingly familiar. This story successfully details the daily experiences of being Black in America and the performative activism and “wokeness” of white people in America. This story has stuck with me, and I hope it does for anyone else who reads the book.

                <h4><em>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</em> - V.E. Schwab</h4>
                <p>
                    Addie LaRue was born in the 17th century. Not wanting to give up her freedoms to marriage, she accidentally makes a deal with the Darkness. Her curse: the ability to live forever, but never be remembered. The story follows Addie throughout the century-long life and the traces she left behind. In 2014, she meets someone who remembers her, and a romantic story ensues.
                    <br><br>
                    Romance and immortality piqued my interest when selecting this book. While it isn’t YA, it can lean that way, but I really enjoyed that. <em> The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</em>  explores what it means to leave a mark on the world. It can be harsh, romantic and magical all at once. I joke that if you were once emo or scene, you would really enjoy this book because of the way it intertwines darkness, beauty and art. I loved following Addie as she learned how to survive and as she fell in love with the world.

                <h4><em>The Beauty in Breaking</em> - Michele Harper</h4>
                <p>
                    <em>The Beauty in Breaking</em> is a memoir following the complexities Michele Harper faces as a child growing up in a broken home, a Black woman, a divorcee and an ER doctor. Her life shows the impact that race and upbringing has on a person’s actions. Each chapter details an experience she has with a patient and her professional and personal learnings. With each patient, Michele learns what it means to break down and how to recover over time.
                    <br><br>
                    As someone who is very uncomfortable with anything relating to the medical field, I was not sure that I would enjoy this book. I was mistaken. This is a thought-provoking book about what it means to keep living when life is challenging. I, also, learned a lot about the bureaucracy of hospitals at a time in which hospitals are running short on beds and dealing with a pandemic. Additionally, the challenges Michele faces as a Black woman in a predominantly white environment are enlightening. The medical field has a lot of changes it needs to make to create an inclusive environment for doctors and patients. While some of the stories are sad and hard to read, I think this book connects major societal challenges.
