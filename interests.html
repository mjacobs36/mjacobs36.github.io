                        <h3>Baking</h3>
                        <p>When I was a sophemore in college, I moved into an apartment and off of the meal plan. My family didn't believe I would be able to cook for myself, but I knew I would be fine.
                           I took a picture of my meals everyday for the entire school year and sent it to my family. I won that bet. 
                           My love for cooking, baking and food videos has only grown. I've been experimenting a lot with different breads and have tried a lot of recipes in quarantine. I even did the sourdough thing. 
                           Here are some of my favorite <a href="baking.html">recipes</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Reading</h3>
                        <p>I love a good story, especially one where I learn something. Since joining a book club, I've been reading a lot more lately. 
                            Here are some of my favorites that I have read recently. I highly recommend all of them. Check out my <a href="books.html">book reviews</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Playlist</h3>
                        <p>Music has always been an important aspect of my life. I took guitar and voice lessons for a while and was even in one of those suburban teen bands. 
                            While I haven't played in a while, I love to find new music and go to concerts. I put together a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7maJlvCXfFab4YlRL0qDpH?si=7q-ZE7pOS9KUdzF9tnT5_w">playlist </a> of songs I can't stop listening to.</p>

                        <h3>Travel</h3>
                        <p>I have had the opportunity to travel to some beautiful places in and outside of America. 
                            While we are not able to travel at the moment, I love to look back at my photos an think about each trip.
                            My favorite thing to do when I get to a new city is go on a walking tour. It is a great way to learn about the culture and history of a place, and get some insider tips.
